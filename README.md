# population-dynamics-simulation
A program to simulate population dynamics visually or with summary statistics.

population_dynamics.py is has several options:
1. Watch a single simulation of rabbits and foxes moving at constant speeds in a forest. Foxes can eat rabbits and rabbits can reproduce, though they have a maximum carrying capacity of 50 individuals.
2. Skip the visual simulation and see the half-life of rabbit populations when utilising different strategies (speed).
3. Skip the visual simulation and see whether over n simulations the rabbits are still alive after some number of generations.
